## How to migrate from 0.x to 1.x

In 1.x, we [removed most of the UI components](https://github.com/oursky/react-native-oursky/commit/8d5d76b9c8a83069469310098c991549fac39c4d).

This allows us to remove many third party dependencies. If you want to upgrade to 1.x and your project is using the removed components,
please copy them to your project.

## How to install from GitHub

```sh
yarn build
git add --force dist/
git commit
git push <your-remote> <your-branch>
```
